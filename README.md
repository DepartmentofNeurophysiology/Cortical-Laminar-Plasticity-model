# Thalamocortical model (N4)

**Master's internship project:** Model of the canonical thalamocortical Th --> L4 --> L2/3 pathway in rodent primary somatosensory cortex (S1). This four-layered feedforward model network serves as a tool for investigating robustness of stimuli representation in S1 after deprivation of various synaptic projection types. Synaptic deprivation was introduced as decreased probability of forming projections between neurons.

Model is made using DynaSim, Matlab-based toolbox for modeling and simulating neural systems (Sherfey et al., 2018).
